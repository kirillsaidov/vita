# Welcome to Vita Wiki!
Vita is a general purpose standard library for quick prototyping with C. It includes various containers, command line arguments parser, logger, functionality to work with paths and files, and many more. No external dependencies.

## Overview
Vita is organized into three categories of modules:
1. **Regular Modules**  
   These are stable and ready-to-use modules intended for general use. Examples include `container`, `system`, `path`, and others.
2. **Experimental Modules**  
   These modules contain in-progress or cutting-edge features that are still under development or testing. They may change frequently and are not yet considered stable. They reside in the `vita/experimental/*` and will be moved out once completed.
3. **Legacy Modules**  
   These modules are located in `vita/legacy/*`. They include outdated or deprecated code retained for backward compatibility or historical reference.
